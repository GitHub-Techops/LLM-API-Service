        DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) 
        and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development 
        life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.
        
        Key DevOps practices include:
        - Continuous Integration (CI): Automatically testing code changes
        - Continuous Delivery (CD): Automating deployment pipelines
        - Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Managing infrastructure through code
        - Monitoring and Logging: Tracking system performance
        - Collaboration: Breaking down silos between teams
        
        Popular DevOps tools include Jenkins, GitLab, Docker, Kubernetes, 
        Terraform, Ansible, Prometheus, and Grafana.
        
        DevOps helps organizations deliver applications faster while 
        maintaining high quality and reliability.
